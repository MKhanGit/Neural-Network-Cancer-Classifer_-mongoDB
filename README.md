# Neural-Network-Cancer-Classifer_mongoDB
This project is an interactive applet for a python based neural network which has been trained on ~700 records of benign and malignant tumor cells. It randomly shuffles a deck of cell measurements and display them to the user, who can then pass them through the previously trained network, which attempts to classify each cell as "benign" or "malignant". For a deployed demo, please visit https://theoryofgravity.ca/mongo/cells/
